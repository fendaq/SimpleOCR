This is a OCR project of DD2424 Deep Learning in Data Science, KTH. 

Our project aims at tect detection and recognition of web images. The codes are divided into two parts:Detection and Recognition.

In recognition, we use a structure similar to https://github.com/Belval/CRNN, which focuses on latin character recognition. The structure can be briefly described as CNN-LSTM, and CTC Loss is used.
